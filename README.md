## License Restrictions
1. Only for elite engineers writing Swift - Do not waste this on Objective-C.

2. Must have a natural affinity for good design other wise I don't want to see this theme on your Xcode.

3. Must only be used on a Retina display Macbook or 4K+ external monitor. Anything less and you are infringing on this license, I will sue. The colors will only pop on a great display. Anything less and you are hurting the marketability of this theme which is an infringement.

4. As the author, I'm the only one with the legal right to break rule 3., I can't afford a 4K external monitor ATM.

5. Share & Enjoy!
